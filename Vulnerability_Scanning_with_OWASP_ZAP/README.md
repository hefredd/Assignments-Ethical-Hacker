# Automated Vulnerability Scanning with OWASP ZAP
## Overview
This lab focuses on Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) using the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). The objective was to perform an automated security audit of a web application to identify high-risk vulnerabilities and cross-reference them with the OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) for professional verification.

## Learning Objectives
Configuring and launching automated web scans (Spidering & Active Scanning).

Interpreting ZAP Alerts and risk levels (High, Medium, Low, Informational).

Analyzing Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-1823).

Utilizing the OWASP WSTG framework to research standardized testing methodologies.

## Execution Methodology
### 1. Automated Reconnaissance (Spidering)
I utilized ZAP’s spidering engine to crawl http://172.17.0.2/dvwa. This mapped the entire directory structure and identified all accessible entry points for the subsequent active scan.

### 2. Active Vulnerability Scanning
ZAP performed an active scan, sending malicious payloads to test for known vulnerabilities. This identified approximately 13 security alerts, ranging from configuration issues to critical execution flaws.

### 3. Deep-Dive: CVE-2012-1823 (RCE)
A critical alert was flagged regarding an out-of-date PHP version.

The Risk: This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject PHP code into query strings, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

The Reference: I used the WSTG identifier provided in ZAP to access the official OWASP documentation, which outlines manual testing steps to confirm this specific flaw.

## Key Takeaways & Mitigation
Automated scanning is a vital first step, but it must be supplemented with manual research. Key defenses identified include:

Regular Patching: Keeping server-side languages (like PHP) and frameworks updated to prevent known RCE exploits.

Standardized Testing: Implementing the WSTG framework ensures that security audits are consistent, thorough, and aligned with industry best practices.

Security Persistence: Using session persistence in ZAP to track vulnerability remediation over time.
